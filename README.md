## Notice
We decided to restart after a few years of hiatus. This is to take advantage of changes made to gamemaker, the tool used to make MMXE run.

We intend to use as little code as possible from the old version going forward. This includes things like weapons, stages, bosses, and enemies.

# Mega Man X Engine Version 2
Mega Man X Engine is a framework being developed using GameMaker that implements common Mega Man X game features so you don't have to start from scratch, plus a few extra features to make better games. 

This is NOT a game. We will NOT add things if you ask us. We CANNOT take money from people. 

## Social Media
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@MMXEngine
- Discord: https://discord.gg/dXygbY9

The majority of updates come from discord. If you need help, go ask there!

# How to use
Get Gamemaker. For best compatibility, use 2024.4.1.152 as this is the version used to develop MMXE.

After that, go click on the code button here in the github page and click on the download option in the dropdown menu. This will download a copy of the project files onto your computer so you can edit your own local copy of the code.

Once you have your own local copy of the engine, you are capable of making your own changes! Read the wiki for help, and if the wiki does not contain what you need go to the discord and ask help there!

# Wiki
This Github features a wiki page 

https://github.com/Dragon-Developer/MMXE/wiki

If you want to learn the ins and outs of the engine, start there. It includes pages on:

- A description of the animation system
- Doccumentation on adding new characters, armors, etc
- How to add new enemies (Currently unfinished)
- Some programming syntax
- How to add new levels and some tips and tricks for creating good levels.

  New features will be added with time. If you want a feature we cannot/do not want to add, feel free to fork this repository and add it in yourself. The mmxe team is happy to show you the inner workings of the engine.
