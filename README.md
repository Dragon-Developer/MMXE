#Megaman X Engine Version 2
We decided to restart after a few years of hiatus. This is to take advantage of changes made to gamemaker, the tool used to make MMXE run.

#How to use
Get Gamemaker, any variety should do. 

For best compatibility, use 2024.4.1.152 as this is the version used to develop MMXE.

after that, go click on the code button in the github (here) and click on the download option in the dropdown. This will download a copy of the project files so you can edit them as you want.
