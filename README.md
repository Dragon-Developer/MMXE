# Mega Man X Engine Version 2
We decided to restart after a few years of hiatus. This is to take advantage of changes made to gamemaker, the tool used to make MMXE run.

Mega Man X Engine is a framework being developed using GameMaker that implements common Mega Man X games so you don't have to start from scratch, plus a few assets showing what you can do with the engine.

This is NOT a game. We will NOT add things if you ask us.

## Social Media
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@MMXEngine
- Discord: https://discord.gg/dXygbY9

The majority of updates come from discord. If you need help, go there!

# How to use
Get Gamemaker, any variety should do. 

For best compatibility, use 2024.4.1.152 as this is the version used to develop MMXE.

After that, go click on the code button in the github (here) and click on the download option in the dropdown. This will download a copy of the project files so you can edit them as you want.
