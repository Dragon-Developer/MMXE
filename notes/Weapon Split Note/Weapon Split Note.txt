weapons were split into melee and projectiles because forte thought it would make it more distinctive

while both weapons are (should) be interchangeible, they also do very different things when you look at it
a good example is zero's 3 slash combo when compared to the charge shot
one happens in a sequence and the other happens after a charging sequence

some special weapons, like rising fire charged shot, may use the melee type instead of the projectile type
this is because charged rising fire is a melee attack, and it would benefit from using that code instead
