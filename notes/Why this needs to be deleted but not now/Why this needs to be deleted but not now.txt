This folder holds graphics that forte, or any other development team member, did not want to use the
collage system to add in. this folder needs cleaning because the end goal is to use collage as much as
possible because its way more usable than the ingame sprites (external editors can actually edit graphics!)

I added charge effects here as I dont know how to use collage on top of another collage image.
